76561198036273792,"Posted June 12, 2014.",220.0,"I never was a big fan of the Half-Life series, I especially though this game was decent at least, but other people seem to call this ""the best FPS ever"" and ""one of the best games ever"". Personally, I just thought the game was mediocre.The gameplay is nothing really that special, it's a first person shooter, and a very simple one at that. I do like the range of weapons, from pistols to rifles to shotguns, and you can carry them all at one, so there is a lot of variety, much like Bioshock. However, the puzzles are extermely straight forward and the vehicles are so finicky, I press the D key for a millisecond and the entire boat goes in a 90 degree angle, the gameplay was just simple and nothing special. It just got boring for me in the end.The graphics weren't bad, for 2004 they look quite good, but to today's standards, they are a bit outdated to today's standard's like Infamous Second Son and the new Wolfenstein. Also I didn't care for the story or the character's for that matter, especially Gordon Freeman. He is possibly one of the boring video game protagonist. He is basically just there as a object of plot, he could be more intersting if we actually heard him speak, but he is just boring. People say that he is like Link from the Legend of Zelda, but the thing with Link is you can see his facial expreesions and see how he is feeling, making him more developed, Freeman is blank with no word of dialouge and no face in game. He is not a charactter, he is an object.Personally, I don't like this game, because of the high critical acclaim it got, and it had a very sour payoff. If you like this game, that's fine, go ahead and play it, but for me, I'll pass when Half-Life 3 eventually comes out.",0.98,Half-Life 2

debstup,"Posted July 3, 2014.",4000.0,"For a game that has sold 6 million copies (as of 17 Sept 2014), Gmod still continues to have glitches, errors and map mishaps causing joining friends' servers to become more torturous than need be.Yes, one CAN go read forums for solutions to problems and issues. However, when problems keep continuously happening over and over again, one tires of spending the majority of their time on the game frustratedly trying to fix the game instead of actually playing it.Although, in those rare moments that the game manages to load properly for everyone playing together, it is an immensely enjoyable game to play with friends. At first I recommended it to everyone, however, the more people I played with, the more problems (that could be fixed easily by updates) seemed to arise. Maps, content or textures that people had already owned would not register when they tried to play the game and either resulted in the person not being able to join the server at all (wouldn't even let them download the missing items from the workshop), or joining a server with huge error signs and checkers causing massive lag.10/10 for fun and entertainment, 0/10 for ease of playing.

SpiritOfDeath2,"Posted June 7, 2015.",4000.0,"Can i recommend Gmod as a game?The answer to that is no, i can not.I cant even say its good by itself. Then there is the steam workshop, and the addons for Gmod. Can i still recommend these as a game? Again, I cant say that these addons are a game, besides the countless addon ""gamemode"" types that are abundant on youtube. I will instead call it a toybox. A world where you can create your own fun, if you have a creative enough mind. I once made a map where you would need to run through a city, where nearly 100 invincible, instant killing, super fast blue creatures were trying to kill you, to get to a tardis to escape, not only from those creatures, but also now some gunships closing onto the tardis. The safe place was a part of the skybox for that map, where you had a jukebox and pets to keep you company. If you are wondering who were the creatures, and what were the pets, the creatures were deadly, and have a named to be feared. They were known as the ""Sanics"" (no that is not a mispelling) and i had various eeveeloutions as pets (pokemon). This is one of the scenarios you can create with the mods avaible on the workshop. A few more that are fun are building space empires, selling and buying spaceships, going to a cinema in order to watch youtube videos, survive a zombie onslaught, create NPC wars, Spawn in a powerful NPC and attempt to kill it (my favourite being the guardian from Doom 3). This game is not good by itself. The mods are not good by themselves. It is what you make of them and how you use them is what makes this game good.",0.9295,Garry's Mod

debstup,"Posted July 3, 2014.",4000.0,"For a game that has sold 6 million copies (as of 17 Sept 2014), Gmod still continues to have glitches, errors and map mishaps causing joining friends' servers to become more torturous than need be.Yes, one CAN go read forums for solutions to problems and issues. However, when problems keep continuously happening over and over again, one tires of spending the majority of their time on the game frustratedly trying to fix the game instead of actually playing it.Although, in those rare moments that the game manages to load properly for everyone playing together, it is an immensely enjoyable game to play with friends. At first I recommended it to everyone, however, the more people I played with, the more problems (that could be fixed easily by updates) seemed to arise. Maps, content or textures that people had already owned would not register when they tried to play the game and either resulted in the person not being able to join the server at all (wouldn't even let them download the missing items from the workshop), or joining a server with huge error signs and checkers causing massive lag.10/10 for fun and entertainment, 0/10 for ease of playing.

aidenisbae,"Posted June 20, 2015.",240.0,"Biggest CS noob right here. This game is fun. Not many players on servers. I only found 1 that had a consistent 20 players at all times, but at least you can do bot matches. The shooting is great, the graphics are nice and don't look too dated. The only annoyance I have is with some of the sounds, which are straight from the original game. I know that all they did was port it to a new engine but at least they could've added in some new walking sounds. Get it on sale, or get it full price. Its worth every penny, trust me. Just keep in mind that there aren't many people who play this, so you might want friends to play with. If you're looking for a multiplayer shooter with lots of players, great shooting and great graphics, get Global Offensive. If you're looking for all of that, minus lots of players get CS: Source.

oddso,"Posted May 10, 2015.",220.0,"Got it today and played around 6 hours of it. One of the most engaging and awesome looking games ever. Well worth the $10. What makes this game one of the best games is the scenery; destroyed buildings, blown-up cars and other people. The story is very engaging and the loading times are super quick. Im also running this on a crappy little tablet with graphics on high and I still have around 100fps. If you havent already got Half Life 2 get it! Also dont worry if you havent played Half Life (Number 1) because I have not and I understand the  majority of the story.EDIT: Just finished it and it is easily the best game I have ever played. The story is the best and so engaging that I just want to live in City 17 regardless of it's owners. I would like to personally thank Valve for making such a great game and all the voice actors. Thanks so much for a game that I will remember forever.2nd EDIT: Playing through a second time and finishing off some acheivements and trying for 100%.

SpiritOfDeath2,"Posted June 7, 2015.",4000.0,"Can i recommend Gmod as a game?The answer to that is no, i can not.I cant even say its good by itself. Then there is the steam workshop, and the addons for Gmod. Can i still recommend these as a game? Again, I cant say that these addons are a game, besides the countless addon ""gamemode"" types that are abundant on youtube. I will instead call it a toybox. A world where you can create your own fun, if you have a creative enough mind. I once made a map where you would need to run through a city, where nearly 100 invincible, instant killing, super fast blue creatures were trying to kill you, to get to a tardis to escape, not only from those creatures, but also now some gunships closing onto the tardis. The safe place was a part of the skybox for that map, where you had a jukebox and pets to keep you company. If you are wondering who were the creatures, and what were the pets, the creatures were deadly, and have a named to be feared. They were known as the ""Sanics"" (no that is not a mispelling) and i had various eeveeloutions as pets (pokemon). This is one of the scenarios you can create with the mods avaible on the workshop. A few more that are fun are building space empires, selling and buying spaceships, going to a cinema in order to watch youtube videos, survive a zombie onslaught, create NPC wars, Spawn in a powerful NPC and attempt to kill it (my favourite being the guardian from Doom 3). This game is not good by itself. The mods are not good by themselves. It is what you make of them and how you use them is what makes this game good.",0.9295,Garry's Mod

IT'S AWESOME!I'm the type of guy who loves indie games, for the freedom, not having to be restricted to a specific task. Garry's Mod is one of those games. In it, you get to do whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want, however you want! I can guarantee the most popular part is the workshop. The mods that users have uploaded there are amazing. From Minecraft gamemodes to Five Nights At Freddy's NPC's, to Shrink guns to horror maps. The possibilities are endless! One of my favourite parts are the different tools that are included. With different tools such as the Camera, Face Poser, Finger Poser, Inflator and more, I've been able to make quite a few animations. You may have seen quite a few famous animations that were made in Garry's Mod, such as The Last Wave by ARMaster, or a more recent one, Friendly Foxy by NoobMister. They were brilliantly made in Garry's Mod!Definitely worth the money, whether you want to animate, test out mods, or just generally screw around!",0.9884,Garry's Mod

Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.""Where do I start?"" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm..._The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more._Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore._Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds._Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want._My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Story: N/ASound: 8/10Replayability: 10/10Overall 8.5Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

ArMeDNeo,"Posted July 25, 2014.",304930.0,"This game reminds me of Minecraft and DayZ but especially DayZ and to say that about a free game is BRILLIANT. The game is so good with many weapons to use to slice, shoot, bash and more to those annoying zombies and the maps are great but make sure that if you go on the Arena map that u are with some friends because if you aren't then you will get pretty bored... trust me there isn't much in that map for 1 person. BUT the other map is EPIC it is huge, filled with towns, militairy bases, barns and more with awesome and I mean AWESOME weapons and other materials for you to use to survive the undead world. But the multiplayer is a let down since you can hardly get into a server in fact i don't even know if you CAN get into a server with the complication of ip's, port's and stuff but the developer might update that so I still recommend this game because of the EPIC singleplayer and if your thinking what the controls will be like and if they are like DayZ's alien controls then don't worry the controls on Unturned are great and you can adjut them if you want anyway. Oh and there is stuff like customization to your character. WOW this is alot like DayZ but just with Minecraft themed graphics. So much to do in this game and it's FREE so i suggest you go and annihilate some zombies in Unturned!",0.998,Unturned

In CSS you can't spray, there's no RNG and it's more balanced. In CSGO, you can spray with weapons like the Bizon, there is so much RNG with your weapon accuracy and the weapons arsenal is biased in favour of the Terrorist team.One of the biggest turnoffs is the extremely toxic community. Let us compare CSS and CSGO once again: In CSS you had chill, down to Earth people who you could talk to, make friends, learn about the game, etc. CSGO's community on the other hand is full of raging tryhards who flame everyone, even their own team, and act like they're the hot shot who is carrying the team.

DarkTitan9174,"Posted June 22, 2014.",4000.0,"I love Garry's Mod first up. I've had some of the best times playing with friends on Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist Town and murder and things like that. There are infinite add ons and so much fun to be had.But the multiplayer public servers are awful sometimes.If you have no friends online and you don't feel like sandbox, you can go on to multiplayer online to open servers to play TTT, murder, Prop Hunt, etc... But the people on these servers are just awful most of the time. What I've noticed is that there's a very limited selection of the types of people in Garry's Mod. Either it's the squealers that have the most annoying voices sometimes and say vulgar things, or 18 year olds that sound like they have nothing to do with their lives. I'm not saying all people are like this, but it's just how it usually is. RDMer's in TTT are the worst who kill for no reason, and another thing in TTT is how people are suspicious of the littlest of things. I cannot recommend the multiplayer servers.Another cheap sort of way to get money is to buy Counter-Strike: Source along with it. That's another $15 on the $10 price tag, and you (like me) may think ""I don't want to buy it"" and will probably wonder why it comes as a bundle. See, the thing is, that in Garry's Mod, if you don't have the certain texture or addon for an item or map, there will be huge red error signs and purple and black squares so you can't see the items. And some of the neccesities for this game in terms of maps and textures come with Counter-Strike: Source. And if you don't, you have to go online and find ALL THE TEXTURES and ALL THE MAPS in a bundle, open up your Steam folder and dragging them in. These packs take about half an hour to download, and you need to download all the gamemodes, excess maps and so many other things if you want to play online properly.  I mean, come on, at least give us a warning guys. To me this seems like a ripoff if you didn't know and a cheap way of getting money.Overall, I really love Garry's Mod, but I love it the most when I'm playing with friends on a private match or by myself in Sandbox. If you're gonna buy it for online multiplayer, I do not recommend it. If you're going to buy it to play with friends and the occasional online multiplayer, I fully recommend it.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Great gamemodes-A lot to do and downloadCons:-Bad community-Textures and addons (sometimes)I will keep Garry's Mod at a 7/10(i know this is a very negative review, but I just wanted to let you know the bad about Gmod before you buy it)",-0.9394,Garry's Mod

thomasonefoot,"Posted September 28, 2014.",220.0,"Half-Life 2 was created by Valve in 2004 and still holds up, ten years later. You play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist with a shotgun and a gravity gun! The graphics aren't fantastic by today's standards but you can imagine how great they would have been upon the 2004 release. You get control of a diverse range of weapons and vehicles, facing countless different enemies, from zombies to trigger happy law enforcers. Set in a dystopian world, the game has huge variation in level design and crushing combine soldeirs with a huge metal crate lifted by a magnetised crane never gets old. One of the best things however, is the awesome physics engine this game has to offer. You can use your gravity gun to move objects around you, often rewarding you with the satisfaction of firing a metal disc to take a zombie's head off. This game can be found on the steam store for cheap and will be well worth your money. I say bring on Half-Life 3!",0.9815,Half-Life 2

JunglisJust-M-tlifewithmegg,"Posted December 12, 2015.",10.0,"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us.This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",0.9901,Counter-Strike

hazixstar,"Posted September 19, 2015.",105600.0,"Ok, so first off, I bought this game a long time ago. Then a couple months ago I played it and there were so many new things introduced, like Telelporter, rainbow torches, and a Xenostaff??? Anyways, they've made a massive change, mostly for the good of the game. (Was kind of getting boring... :P)However after you installed the update and started playing with your friends with the new ""Join via Steam"" option, you'd realise how much stuff you could get. My buds and I were like ""Woah dude that sick! Yeah man, lets craft everything in the game... <Not really. We thought we were going to have the time of our lives, playing a crafting/survival game together, crafting tons of items...Then after about of month of playing, I realised that we weren't going anywhere quickly,we thought that because we defeated the Wall of Flesh, that we were unstoppable with all of the items that we recieved from the goodie bags. We thought that until the Pirate invasion came, that really hit us hard. We eventually got through it and we kept going through the game.A couple days later my Youth minister came, he was wearing sick as armour and had awesome gear, we thought he had like finished the game! But then a couple days ago he said that the gear that he had was useless junk considering who he was up against.Thats when it hit me, bro, this game at least is gonna take about a year and a half to finish, and I have a life to live for a reason. And so that is when I bought ARK: Survival Evolved and that was good, but repeptative... Anyways, there are a lot more other games to play which are better than this, don't waste your money and your life on this. Buy Dota 2, its a fun game that only lasts for about 40mins a match...Only get Terraria if you don't want a life... ",0.9743,Terraria

Anyway the Owner Bob Dylan (Avoid this guy) went on to try and convince the kid to ask more and more, of course I think this is apalling so I step in and tell Bob Dylan to back off and explain to Batman the reason why his parents don't want him donating his money (keep in mind this kid is around 10 years old so his grasp on reality is pretty dodgy), anyway the QG|Bob Dylan bans me for this.So sorry for my rant, but there isn't really a better way to tell everyone, but yeah Gmod is excellent.",0.8272,Garry's Mod

DarkKnight2599,Posted August 12.,4000.0,"Garry's Mod is one of the oldest games out there on steam. However, it's still one of the most popular and most played games on Steam. Garry's Mod is an endless sandbox game which is a sandbox version of the well and known played game, Half Life 2. This allows the user to interact with many things such as objects, cars, ragdolls, etc. From this, the user is able to create anything, they can build contraptions, boats, vehicles, houses, towers, etc. The possibilities are endless! From my experiences, I have overall spent 3,000+ hours onto this game and I've never gotten bored of it yet, not even a little since not only does Garry's Mod include Sandbox mode, there are many more other modes. Some made by Garry and the rest made by the Garry's Mod Community. In addition, Garry's Mod also includes a workshop which allows people to upload their work of art, new items such as weapons, maps, vehicles, etc. Garry's Mod is mostly made up by the community. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to everybody highly because of the price and the infinite possibilities.And there's the other side.

BokuNoSekai,"Posted July 23, 2014.",4000.0,"Let's see... Now, where do i start? Well, i wanted Garry's Mod since 2012 because i though that it looked fun. Well, guess what? It isn't. I mean, there are a few awesome stuff in Gmod, but they just die too quickly. It usually won't start saying that no steam user was found. Overall, it's a terrible game. I'm sure you're wondering why the hell am i recommending this ""game"" if i hate it. Well, when i say that Gmod is a terrible game, i meant that Gmod is terrible for playing games. Let me guess... Are you confused right now? Don't know what i'm talking about? This is what i'm trying to say:Gmod's sandbox is kind of dull and boring. It's just like Half-Life 2 with sv_cheats 1. Trouble in terrorist town (TTT) isn't really my thing. Cinema? One word: Mac. DarkRP? LOADING IS LOVE, LOADING IS LIFE. So, i've said many terrible things. What's the good part? Well, the only good part here is the sandbox. Not the killing-combines-and-striders-with-a-freaking-vuvuzela sandbox, but the creative sandbox. You can build almost everything in the sandbox. If you're not the engineering kind of guy, you can pose characters and create a story for the picture.Not enough? Then make a video with Gmod! You don't need any fancy-dancy stuff like Frappucinos (fraps) or Sonic Vegeta Noob (Sony Vegas Pro)! Just use Quicktime player and Imovie! (unless you have windows. Then i'm afraid you're screwed.) Gmod is not a time killing ""game"". Heck, i won't even call this a game! It's more of like a tool. A tool made to train your imagination. A tool to become a kid again. (Even if the game is gory) And so far, no other application has been able to pull this off.Except for paint. That application catches your application so damn well.",-0.9532,Garry's Mod

HackingPro1,"Posted September 28, 2013.",4000.0,"(if you cant be bothered reading this then just scroll down for the rating and reasons on why it's good and bad)It's a really good game considering its price however it does take a week to get used to the controls and how some of the gamemodes work in it but they don't have a tutorial... It's annoying how you do need CS: Source to view a lot of maps and items that most servers use but you can get those textures for free off of websites which is legal (just in case you think it isn't) or you can do it through a tiny bit more legitament way by buying it with Garry's Mod or standalone but I highly recommend buying it in a bundle as it does lower the price by quite a bit. If you can't be bothered installing all the textures by downloading them online then buying it would be better for you as all you need to do is download CS: Source and just go back onto Garry's Mod but if your like me and your going to barely play CS: Source then just buy it on a sale or download the textures (to be honest I did both because I downloaded the textures but about a month later the game was about $2 so I bought it anyway).7/10 for...Negatives:- Making it incredibly dificult to download the textures.- Forcing you to have them in the first place- Making CS:source way too overpriced considering it's not even that good compared to CS: GO which is newer and cheaper- No tutorials- Overly complicated tools considering thier is no tutorialPositives:- Lowering the price to $1 on sales- Making the original price $10 (considering its a online only game)- In-built workshop compatibility- So many different gamemodes- Some gamemodes are mixed in with others on some servers to create the ultimate game (sort of like Sandbox where you can do what you want and build with PVP where you can still do what you want but no flying through walls, building bases, killing others and still building amazing contraptions).In summary Garry's Mod is a great casual game that you can play everyday if you want but it isnt hardcore so it's meant to be more of a entertaining, funny game which is a lot better to play with friends and if you don't have friends then use a mic while playing on servers as it will be just as much entertaining (you don't have to have a mic either you can also type in chat).",0.9968,Garry's Mod

But to its credit it's fun to play (But only so long as you have friends, single player is boring really), its very mod friendly with tons of mods you can download and use from skins for your characters and weapons to redone animations to fully fledged levels so if you are the type of person who enjoys that sort of thing then this is a game for you.Not really my thing considering I almost never play it with friends ever, but if you have a good abundance of friends whom you play a lot of games with, this is certainly a title worth considering.",0.9922,Left 4 Dead 2

DarkTitan9174,"Posted June 22, 2014.",4000.0,"I love Garry's Mod first up. I've had some of the best times playing with friends on Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist Town and murder and things like that. There are infinite add ons and so much fun to be had.But the multiplayer public servers are awful sometimes.If you have no friends online and you don't feel like sandbox, you can go on to multiplayer online to open servers to play TTT, murder, Prop Hunt, etc... But the people on these servers are just awful most of the time. What I've noticed is that there's a very limited selection of the types of people in Garry's Mod. Either it's the squealers that have the most annoying voices sometimes and say vulgar things, or 18 year olds that sound like they have nothing to do with their lives. I'm not saying all people are like this, but it's just how it usually is. RDMer's in TTT are the worst who kill for no reason, and another thing in TTT is how people are suspicious of the littlest of things. I cannot recommend the multiplayer servers.Another cheap sort of way to get money is to buy Counter-Strike: Source along with it. That's another $15 on the $10 price tag, and you (like me) may think ""I don't want to buy it"" and will probably wonder why it comes as a bundle. See, the thing is, that in Garry's Mod, if you don't have the certain texture or addon for an item or map, there will be huge red error signs and purple and black squares so you can't see the items. And some of the neccesities for this game in terms of maps and textures come with Counter-Strike: Source. And if you don't, you have to go online and find ALL THE TEXTURES and ALL THE MAPS in a bundle, open up your Steam folder and dragging them in. These packs take about half an hour to download, and you need to download all the gamemodes, excess maps and so many other things if you want to play online properly.  I mean, come on, at least give us a warning guys. To me this seems like a ripoff if you didn't know and a cheap way of getting money.Overall, I really love Garry's Mod, but I love it the most when I'm playing with friends on a private match or by myself in Sandbox. If you're gonna buy it for online multiplayer, I do not recommend it. If you're going to buy it to play with friends and the occasional online multiplayer, I fully recommend it.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Great gamemodes-A lot to do and downloadCons:-Bad community-Textures and addons (sometimes)I will keep Garry's Mod at a 7/10(i know this is a very negative review, but I just wanted to let you know the bad about Gmod before you buy it)",-0.9394,Garry's Mod

We set up camp and built houses next to each other,. We spent the next in-game week making one massive base together with metal doors to protect us from the bandits. Everything was swell until we heard gunshots in the distance. We climbed on top of our house to see what was going on and saw a few bandits in the distance. We thought nothing of it and went back inside. About five minutes later we heard a massive explosion, one of my team said that it sounded like a C4 explosion. We go downstairs and sewe that one of our doors has been blown off. Next thing we know 6 guys in kevlar come into our house holding m4's. We were outnumbered, 3 to 6. One of my mates pulls out a shotgun and shoots one of them in the head and kills them, about half a second later he is lying dead on the floor. One of the guys tells us to drop all our weapons on the ground as the other guys procede to looting all our hard earned goods. I dropped everything I had on me except for a P250 and some ammo. For about 20 minutes the two of us were being led by these raiders along a road when a guy with a bow starts shooting at them. He dies pretty much instantly but it gave us enough time to run. As gun shots whistle past my chest and head I begin to think this is it, I'm done for. We keep running we see some mountains up ahead. We start weaving through the mountains and we eventually loose the bandits. We set up camp and call it home. Over the chat the bandits are yelling abuse at us and saying that they will hunt us down, let us re-spawn and hunt us down again. That was 5 hours of playing Rust, I can't wait to see what happens next.TL;DR An amazing game, so much fun and it's only in early Alpha!",-0.3663,Rust

zeshirky,Posted July 22.,4000.0," The game that gave me endless fun years ago. I've played this since 2011 (Gmod 12) but I don't play it as much anymore but I have to say, for someone my age back then, this game was such a blast and I couldn't stop playing it. I remember booting up singleplayer and then downloading stuff off the Toybox seeing what people have created and uploaded including myself uploading a save of a VW Golf and a Nissan 350z and reading comments; Anyway, then I'd download mods off https://garrysmods.org/ and I'd have to figure out how to install them as a 11-12 year old who was new to installing things haha. I'd even mention this game to friends at school and show my friends if they were over. Also I made an abundance of friends playing this game online. Many laughs and tears. :') I've met lots of great people through it. Looking back at my screenshots off my old computer is always giving me nostalgia of the fun I had.This game gave me lots of joy and I can't thank it enough. And it still does when I load it back up and give it a go nowadays. This game has improved in many ways. I really do recommend this game. It is great fun and you can do whatever you like with it! :) Thanks for reading!

After actually finishing it, more than 10 years after its release, I have to say that this might be better than every other FPS out there, except for DOOM, 'cuz DOOM is ♥♥♥♥in' awesome. Great story, decent visuals (even in today's day and age), and immersive physics based puzzles, make Half-Life 2 one of the best single player experiences to date. Hell it's better than 95% of the games that we get today. It lives on, and will preserve its legacy for generations to come. No PC gamer should be without this.9.2/10.
